1 @
  Executes a command procedure. The at sign (@) is the execute-procedure
  command; DCL reads command lines from the named file as though you had
  typed them at the terminal.

  Format:

    @file-spec[.COM] [parameter[ ...]]

  Up to eight parameters may follow the file specification. Inside the
  procedure they are available as the local symbols P1 through P8. The
  default file type is COM.

  Procedures are read from this node's command-procedure store; use EDIT
  to author one and DIRECTORY to list those already present. See also
  HELP SCRIPTING and HELP TUTORIAL.

  Example:

    $ @STARTUP
    $ @GREET MARK

2 Examples
  The procedure is located in the METRO$ROOT: command store. The .COM
  file type need not be typed:

    $ @HELLO
    $ @DEMO

1 ACCOUNTING
  Displays a per-user summary of the resources consumed on this node
  since the system was booted. The metro node keeps a lightweight
  accounting log in place of the SYS$MANAGER:ACCOUNTNG.DAT file used on a
  full VMS system.

  Format:

    ACCOUNTING

1 ACKNOWLEDGE
  Marks one active SCADA alarm, or every active alarm, as seen by the
  operator. Acknowledging an alarm records the operator response in the
  alarm history without clearing the underlying condition; a
  process-driven alarm clears only when its cause is removed, and a
  latched fault clears only at the panel.

  Format:

    ACKNOWLEDGE ALARM {alarm-id | ALL}

  The complete alarm history, with acknowledgement state, is shown by
  SHOW ALARMS.

2 Parameters
  alarm-id

    The sequence number of a single active alarm, as listed by
    SHOW ALARMS.

  ALL

    Acknowledges every alarm currently active.

1 ALLOCATE
  Reserves a device for the exclusive use of your process. A user-class
  device (a scratch disk, a tape drive, or a terminal line) may be
  allocated; system volumes are refused.

  Format:

    ALLOCATE device-name[:]

  The allocation is held until you DEALLOCATE the device or log out.

1 ANALYZE
  Examines the internal structure of a file, an error log, the security
  audit journal, or a system dump. The operator account may inspect the
  error log and audit characteristics; image and crash-dump analysis are
  privileged.

  Format:

    ANALYZE/qualifier [file-spec]

  Additional information available:

  Choose a qualifier subtopic below for details.

2 /ERROR_LOG
  Reports the most recent entries from the system error log, in the
  format produced by ANALYZE/ERROR_LOG on a full VMS system: device
  errors, machine checks, and volume state changes.

  Format:

    ANALYZE/ERROR_LOG

2 /AUDIT
  Displays the security auditing characteristics currently in effect --
  the classes of event (login, breakin, file access, privilege use)
  being written to the audit journal.

  Format:

    ANALYZE/AUDIT

2 /IMAGE
  Analyzes the structure of an executable image. This function is
  privileged and returns %SYSTEM-F-NOPRIV for the operator account.

  Format:

    ANALYZE/IMAGE image-name

2 /CRASH_DUMP
  Reads and formats SYS$SYSTEM:SYSDUMP.DMP. This function is privileged
  and returns %SYSTEM-F-NOPRIV for the operator account.

  Format:

    ANALYZE/CRASH_DUMP dump-file

1 APPEND
  Adds the contents of one or more files to the end of an existing file.
  APPEND is COPY with the records concatenated onto the output file
  rather than replacing it.

  Format:

    APPEND input-file-spec[,...] output-file-spec

1 ASSIGN
  Creates a logical name and equates it to an equivalence string in the
  process logical name table. ASSIGN takes the equivalence name first;
  DEFINE takes the logical name first.

  Format:

    ASSIGN equivalence-name logical-name

  Use SHOW LOGICAL to display the resulting table entry and DEASSIGN to
  remove it.

1 ATTACH
  Transfers control of your terminal from the current process to another
  process in your job. The diagnostic shell has no parent process, so
  ATTACH returns -DCL-W-ATTNOPAR.

  Format:

    ATTACH process-name

1 BACKUP
  Saves, restores, or copies files as a BACKUP save set. The command
  prints the standard BACKUP identification banner and the
  CREATED/COPIED messages.

  Format:

    BACKUP input-specifier output-specifier

  Example:

    $ BACKUP RAME$DATA: MUA0:METRO.BCK

1 START
  Releases a rame from its emergency brake and returns it to service, or
  starts (or resumes) line service after a stop. START LINE also clears
  a line-wide emergency stop.

  Format:

    START RAME label
    START LINE

  Additional information available:

  Choose a form below for details.

2 RAME
  Releases the FU (freinage d'urgence) commanded on a named rame and
  returns it to service. If the rame was not under FU the command
  reports no change.

  Format:

    START RAME label

  Example:

    $ START RAME 101

2 LINE
  Starts line service: the automatic pilot resumes on every rame. If an
  arrêt d'urgence général was in force it is released first. LIGNE is
  accepted as the French spelling.

  Format:

    START LINE

1 CLEAR
  Clears the terminal screen and the scrollback buffer, then redisplays
  the DCL prompt.

  Format:

    CLEAR

1 CLOSE
  Requests the doors of a named rame to close and ends its station
  dwell. The traction interlock releases once every door is proven
  closed and locked.

  Format:

    CLOSE RAME label

1 CONTINUE
  Resumes execution of a command or image that was interrupted by
  CTRL/Y. With nothing interrupted, CONTINUE has no effect.

  Format:

    CONTINUE

1 COPY
  Creates a new file from one or more existing files. In this shell the
  file namespace outside the command-procedure store is read-only, so a
  COPY whose input lies there returns %COPY-E-OPENIN and -RMS-E-FNF.

  Format:

    COPY input-file-spec[,...] output-file-spec

1 CREATE
  Creates a new sequential file. A file created with a .COM type is
  written to the command-procedure store, where EDIT and @ can find it
  later.

  Format:

    CREATE file-spec

1 DEALLOCATE
  Releases a device you previously reserved with ALLOCATE, returning it
  to the pool of free devices.

  Format:

    DEALLOCATE {device-name[:] | /ALL}

  DEALLOCATE/ALL releases every device your process holds.

1 DEASSIGN
  Cancels a logical name assignment made with ASSIGN or DEFINE. An
  undefined name returns %SYSTEM-F-NOLOGNAM.

  Format:

    DEASSIGN logical-name

1 DEFINE
  Creates a logical name and equates it to an equivalence string. DEFINE
  takes the logical name first; ASSIGN takes the equivalence name first.
  The two commands are otherwise identical.

  Format:

    DEFINE logical-name equivalence-name

1 DELETE
  Deletes one or more files. A user-authored .COM file is removed from
  the command-procedure store; a file elsewhere in the read-only
  namespace returns -RMS-E-FNF.

  Format:

    DELETE file-spec[;version]

1 DEPOSIT
  Replaces the contents of memory locations. This command is privileged
  and returns %SYSTEM-F-NOPRIV for the operator account. See EXAMINE for
  the read-only counterpart.

  Format:

    DEPOSIT location=data[,...]

1 DIAGNOSE
  Opens the metro diagnostic test menu, a full-screen selector from
  which brake, door, tire and platform-lamp tests may be launched.
  Press CTRL/Y to leave the menu. See also HELP RUN, which launches the
  same tests by name.

  Format:

    DIAGNOSE

1 DIFFERENCES
  Compares two files record by record and reports the lines that differ.

  Format:

    DIFFERENCES file-spec-1 file-spec-2

1 DIRECTORY
  Displays a list of files, or information about a file or group of
  files, in the command-procedure store.

  Format:

    DIRECTORY [file-spec] [/SIZE] [/DATE] [/FULL]

  Additional information available:

  Choose a qualifier subtopic below for details.

2 /SIZE
  Adds the used and allocated block counts to each entry.

    DIRECTORY/SIZE

2 /DATE
  Adds the creation date and time to each entry.

    DIRECTORY/DATE

2 /FULL
  Displays the full set of file attributes for each entry.

    DIRECTORY/FULL

1 DISMOUNT
  Detaches a volume that was previously mounted on a device with MOUNT.

  Format:

    DISMOUNT device-name[:]

1 EDIT
  Invokes an interactive text editor on a file in the command-procedure
  store. By default EDIT starts the EDT screen editor; EDIT/LINE starts
  the EDT line editor for scripted or line-at-a-time work.

  Format:

    EDIT [/LINE] file-spec

  Additional information available:

  Choose a subtopic below for editor details.

2 Screen_Mode
  The default EDT screen editor. Arrow keys move the cursor; printable
  characters insert at the cursor; RETURN splits the current line; and
  BACKSPACE or DELETE removes the character to the left, joining lines at
  the left margin. PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN scroll the viewport.

  CTRL/Z (or CTRL/X) writes the buffer and exits; CTRL/Y (or ESC ESC)
  discards changes and exits. The CTRL/X and ESC ESC alternatives exist
  for telnet clients whose terminal driver intercepts CTRL/Z and CTRL/Y.

2 /LINE
  Starts the EDT line editor, which prompts with an asterisk (*) and
  accepts the line-mode commands TYPE, INSERT, DELETE, FIND, SUBSTITUTE
  and EXIT. Preferred for editing a procedure from a script.

  Format:

    EDIT/LINE file-spec

1 METRO
  A short worked example of driving a single rame by hand from DCL. The
  rame- and line-specific SET and SHOW subjects live under the VALCP
  layered product; see HELP VALCP for the full reference.

    $ VALCP SET RAME 101 /MANUAL     ! conduite manuelle limitée
    $ VALCP SET RAME 101 /SPEED=8    ! request 8 m/s from the driver desk
    $ VALCP SET RAME 101 /SPEED=0    ! brake to a stand
    $ OPEN RAME 101                  ! open the doors

    $ STOP RAME 101                  ! command the FU (emergency brake)
    $ START RAME 101                 ! release the FU
    $ VALCP SET RAME 101 /AUTOMATIC  ! back to conduite automatique
    $ VALCP SET LIGNE /SP=(1,3,60)   ! shuttle CHU <-> Gare, 60 s headway
    $ VALCP SET LIGNE /NORMAL        ! full-line service restored

1 EXAMINE
  Displays the contents of memory. The value at the given virtual
  address is shown as a longword.

  Format:

    EXAMINE location

  A hexadecimal address may be entered as ^X1000 or as 1000. See DEPOSIT
  for the (privileged) write counterpart.

1 EXIT
  Ends the current command procedure, or, at the interactive prompt,
  ends the DCL session. An optional status value is stored in $STATUS
  for the caller. See also LOGOUT.

  Format:

    EXIT [status-code]

1 FINGER
  Displays the interactive sessions on this node and on any DECnet peers
  discovered on the network, or detailed information about a single user.

1 GOTO
  Within a command procedure, transfers control to a labelled line. The
  target is a line of the form $label: elsewhere in the procedure.

  Format:

    GOTO label

  See HELP SCRIPTING for labels, GOSUB and RETURN.

1 HELP
  Invokes the HELP facility to display information about a command or
  topic. Typed with no topic, HELP displays introductory text and then
  prompts for a topic; typed with a topic, it displays that topic and
  prompts for a subtopic.

  Format:

    HELP [topic [subtopic[ ...]]]

  At the "Topic?" prompt, type a topic name, a question mark (?) to
  redisplay the current text, an asterisk (*) to list everything, or
  press RETURN to move up one level (and, from the top level, to exit).
  Topic names may be abbreviated. Press CTRL/Z at any time to exit HELP.

2 Instructions
  See the INSTRUCTIONS topic for detailed operating instructions.

1 HINTS
  If you do not know the exact name of the command or topic you want,
  choose one of the categories below; each lists the commands that
  belong to it. Then request help on the command by name.

  Short-form aliases follow the interface language: English mode accepts
  TRAIN, FLEET, LINE, STATIONS, PAX, EMERGENCY, RESUME; French mode
  accepts RAME, FLOTTE, LIGNE, GARES, PAX, URGENCE, REPRISE, AIDE.

  Any command can be given the /PAGE qualifier to display long output one
  screenful at a time -- for example  SHOW SYSTEM/PAGE  or  HELP VALCP/PAGE.
  Press RETURN for the next page, or Q to stop. The page length follows
  SET TERMINAL/PAGE.

1 IF
  Tests a condition and, when it is true, executes the command following
  THEN. An optional ELSE clause supplies a command for the false case.

  Format:

    IF expression THEN command [ELSE command]

  The comparison operators each begin and end with a period:

      .EQ. .NE. .LT. .LE. .GT. .GE.    integer comparison
      .EQS. .NES.                       string comparison
      .AND. .OR. .NOT.                  logical combination

  See HELP SCRIPTING for the surrounding procedure language.

1 INITIALIZE
  Formats and labels a volume, destroying any data already on it. This
  command is privileged and returns %SYSTEM-F-NOPRIV for the operator
  account.

  Format:

    INITIALIZE device-name[:] volume-label

1 INSTALL
  Lists the known-image table -- the images made permanently resident by
  the system startup procedure, with their attributes (Open,
  Header-resident, Shared, Linkable).

  Format:

    INSTALL [LIST]

1 INSTRUCTIONS
  HELP displays information in levels. The top level lists commands and
  topics. When you select a topic, HELP shows its text and lists the
  subtopics available beneath it, then prompts for one.

  At any prompt you may:

    o  Type a topic or subtopic name (abbreviations are accepted). Type
       several names on one line to descend directly, for example
       SHOW PROCESS.

    o  Type an asterisk (*) to display everything at the current level,
       or a name containing an asterisk to match a group of topics.

    o  Type a question mark (?) to redisplay the text you last saw.

    o  Press RETURN to move up one level. Pressing RETURN at the
       top-level "Topic?" prompt exits HELP, as does CTRL/Z at any
       prompt.

1 LOGOUT
  Ends the interactive session and closes the terminal. /FULL appends an
  accounting summary of the session.

  Format:

    LOGOUT [/FULL]

1 VALCP
  Invokes the LPD VAL Control Program, the layered product that owns
  every metro-specific SET and SHOW subject. It follows the same
  pattern as the real VMS layered-product control programs (NCP for
  DECnet, LATCP for LAT, and so on).

  Format:

    VALCP subcommand object [parameters] [/qualifiers]

  The short-form command aliases are gated by the interface language.
  The English aliases -- TRAIN, FLEET, LINE, STATIONS, PAX, EMERGENCY,
  RESUME -- resolve only in English mode; the French aliases -- RAME,
  FLOTTE, LIGNE, GARES, PAX, URGENCE, REPRISE, AIDE -- only in French
  mode. So in English mode TRAIN 101 expands to VALCP SHOW RAME 101,
  while in French mode RAME 101 does. The VALCP verb itself and its
  RAME / RAMES / STATIONS / PAX object keywords are the installed
  product's vocabulary and work in either mode; only the LINE / LIGNE
  object and the SET RAME fault qualifiers follow the language.

  Additional information available:

  Choose a subcommand below.

1 SCRIPTING
  An overview of the DCL command-procedure language. Every command line
  in a procedure begins with a dollar sign ($); a line beginning with $!
  is a comment; a line with no leading $ is data echoed to SYS$OUTPUT.

  For a step-by-step guide, type HELP TUTORIAL.

  Additional information available:

  Choose an element below.

2 Symbols
  A symbol is created or updated with the equals sign. String values are
  quoted; integer values are numerals or arithmetic expressions:

    $ SECTEUR = "3B"              ! string symbol
    $ CANTON = 7                  ! integer symbol
    $ CANTON = CANTON + 1         ! integer arithmetic

  SHOW SYMBOL lists the defined symbols. The read-only symbols $STATUS,
  $SEVERITY, $PID, $PROCESS and $RESTART are always available.

2 Substitution
  Enclose a symbol name in apostrophes to substitute its value into a
  command line. Inside a quoted string, use the two-apostrophe opening
  form:

    $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "Rame is in canton ''CANTON'"

2 Labels
  A label is a line of the form $label:. GOTO branches to a label; GOSUB
  calls the code at a label and RETURN comes back to the line after the
  GOSUB:

    $LOOP:
    $   IF COUNT .GT. 5 THEN GOTO DONE
    $   GOSUB STEP
    $   COUNT = COUNT + 1
    $   GOTO LOOP
    $DONE:

2 Conditionals
  IF tests a condition and runs the command after THEN, with an optional
  ELSE branch. See HELP IF for the operator list.

    $ IF CANTON .GT. 8 THEN GOTO TERMINUS

2 Lexical_Functions
  Lexical functions have names beginning with F$ and return a string
  substituted into the command line before it runs:

      F$LENGTH  F$EXTRACT  F$LOCATE  F$INTEGER  F$STRING
      F$EDIT    F$TIME     F$USER    F$MODE     F$ENVIRONMENT
      F$SEARCH  F$TRNLNM   F$PID

  Example:

    $ NAME = F$EDIT("  joe smith ","TRIM,UPCASE,COMPRESS")

2 Invocation
  Run a procedure with the @ command; up to eight parameters become the
  symbols P1 through P8:

    $ @GREET MARK

1 SEARCH
  Searches one or more files for the specified string and displays the
  lines that contain it.

  Format:

    SEARCH file-spec search-string

1 SELFTEST
  Drives every documented DCL verb once, in dry-run mode, and prints a
  per-verb pass or fail line. If the shell is still responsive
  afterwards, every verb dispatches without error. This is the metro
  node's built-in command self-test.

  Format:

    SELFTEST

1 SET
  Modifies the characteristics of your process, your terminal, or the
  session environment. The rame and line SET subjects live under the
  VALCP layered product (see HELP VALCP); SET RAME and SET LIGNE are
  accepted directly as shorthand.

  Format:

    SET option [value]

  Additional information available:

  Choose an option below.

2 RAME
  Shorthand for VALCP SET RAME. See HELP VALCP SET RAME for the full
  qualifier list (mode, manual speed, FU, fault injection, tires).

    SET RAME label /qualifier

2 LIGNE
  Shorthand for VALCP SET LIGNE. See HELP VALCP SET LIGNE for service,
  emergency-stop and service-provisoire control. SET LINE is accepted
  as the EN spelling.

    SET LIGNE /qualifier

2 DEFAULT
  Sets the default device and directory for file operations.

    SET DEFAULT [device:][directory]

2 TERMINAL
  Sets terminal characteristics such as display width and page length.

    SET TERMINAL /WIDTH=n /PAGE=n

2 PROMPT
  Sets the DCL prompt string.

    SET PROMPT="string"

2 PROCESS
  Sets process characteristics such as scheduling priority and name.

    SET PROCESS /PRIORITY=n /NAME=name

2 PASSWORD
  Changes the password of the current account.

    SET PASSWORD

2 ON
  Enables error checking, so that a warning or worse in a procedure
  triggers the established ON action. NOON disables the checking.

    SET {ON | NOON}

2 VERIFY
  Enables command echo, so that each line of a procedure is displayed as
  it executes. NOVERIFY disables the echo.

    SET {VERIFY | NOVERIFY}

2 STANDARD
  Chooses which CBTC standard's terminology the interface presents:
  IEEE 1474.1 (North American) or EN 62290 (European urban guided
  transport). AUTO, the default, follows the interface language --
  French shows EN 62290, English shows IEEE 1474. Affects the safety
  wording in SHOW STATUS.

    SET STANDARD {IEEE | EN62290 | AUTO}

1 SHELVE
  Shelves an active SCADA alarm (ISA-18.2 SHLVD): the alarm is removed from
  the primary annunciator -- the beacon, the panel list and the active
  count -- while remaining in the log so the action stays auditable. Use it
  to silence a known nuisance alarm without losing the record. UNSHELVE
  restores it. Distinct from ACKNOWLEDGE, which keeps the alarm annunciated.

  Format:

    SHELVE ALARM alarm-id

  The alarm sequence number is the one listed by SHOW ALARMS.

1 SHOW
  Displays information about the process, the system, devices, and the
  session environment. The metro subjects (RAME, RAMES, LIGNE, STATIONS,
  PAX) live under the VALCP layered product and are also accepted
  directly -- SHOW RAME 101 is VALCP SHOW RAME 101.

  Format:

    SHOW option

1 SPAWN
  Creates a subprocess to execute a command or an interactive session.
  The diagnostic shell has no subprocess facility, so SPAWN returns
  -DCL-E-NOSUBPROC.

  Format:

    SPAWN [command]

1 STOP
  Commands the FU (freinage d'urgence, emergency brake) on a named rame,
  or an arrêt d'urgence général on the whole line. Release it with
  START.

  Format:

    STOP RAME label
    STOP LINE

  Additional information available:

  Choose a form below for details.

2 RAME
  Commands the FU on one rame: it brakes at the emergency rate and
  holds until START RAME releases it.

    STOP RAME label

2 LINE
  Arrêt d'urgence général: every rame receives the FU at once. LIGNE is
  accepted as the French spelling. Release with START LINE.

    STOP LINE

1 STORAGE
  Describes the on-disk storage that backs the simulated METRO$ROOT:
  volume. Files kept there round-trip between the host and the shell.

  The host directory is:

    $STOREROOT$

  File types kept there:

    *.COM         Command procedures (CREATE / EDIT / TYPE / @ /
                  DELETE / COPY / RENAME / APPEND).
    *.LOG         Batch-job logs written by SUBMIT when a procedure
                  finishes.
    MAILBOX.JSON  The persistent MAIL inbox; it re-seeds with the
                  welcome messages if deleted.

  STARTUP.COM, HELLO.COM and DEMO.COM are seeded into the directory on
  first launch. The INSTALL known-image table lives only in memory and
  re-seeds on every start.

1 SUBMIT
  Queues one or more command procedures to a batch queue for execution
  as a detached job. The prompt returns immediately; the job runs in the
  background.

  Format:

    SUBMIT file-spec[,...]

  When the job finishes, OPCOM posts a notification to this terminal,
  MAIL delivers the captured output, and a .LOG file is written beside
  the .COM (see HELP STORAGE for the host path).

1 TUTORIAL
  A step-by-step tutorial on writing and running DCL command procedures
  on this node. Every example runs on the live shell.

  Additional information available:

  Choose a lesson below, or read them in order.

2 Overview
  A command procedure is a text file containing the lines you would
  otherwise type at the "$" prompt. Every command line begins with a "$"
  so DCL treats it as a command rather than data:

    $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "Hello, world."
    $ EXIT

  Lines beginning with "$!" are comments. Blank lines, and lines with no
  leading "$", are treated as data and echoed to SYS$OUTPUT.

2 Editing
  Use EDIT to open the EDT editor on the file you want to author. Type
  your lines, then write the file and return to DCL. The default file
  type COM need not be typed. See HELP EDIT for the editor commands.

    $ EDIT GREET.COM

2 Running
  Invoke a procedure with "@" followed by its name. Up to eight
  positional parameters follow the name and appear inside the procedure
  as P1 through P8:

    $ @GREET
    $ @GREET MARK

2 Symbols
  A symbol is created with "=". String values are quoted; integers are
  numerals or arithmetic. Substitute a symbol into a line by enclosing
  its name in apostrophes:

    $ CANTON = 7
    $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "Rame is in canton ''CANTON'"

  See HELP SCRIPTING Symbols for the read-only $STATUS and $SEVERITY
  symbols.

2 Branching
  IF is a single-line statement with an optional ELSE. Labels are lines
  of the form $label:; GOTO branches to one, GOSUB calls one and RETURN
  comes back. See HELP IF and HELP GOTO.

    $ IF CANTON .GT. 8 THEN GOTO TERMINUS

2 Lexical_Functions
  Lexical functions (names beginning with F$) return strings substituted
  into the command line before it runs -- F$TIME, F$USER, F$EDIT,
  F$EXTRACT, and others. See HELP SCRIPTING Lexical_Functions.

    $ NAME = F$EDIT("  joe smith ","TRIM,UPCASE")

2 Example
  This procedure exercises the doors of every rame in the fleet and
  prints a summary. Save it as SWEEP.COM and run it with @SWEEP:

    $ ! SWEEP.COM -- cycle the doors of rames 101..103
    $ N = 101
    $LOOP:
    $   IF N .GT. 103 THEN GOTO DONE
    $   ID = F$EDIT(F$STRING(N),"TRIM")
    $   OPEN RAME 'ID'
    $   WAIT 00:00:03
    $   CLOSE RAME 'ID'
    $   N = N + 1
    $   GOTO LOOP
    $DONE:
    $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "Sweep complete at ''F$TIME()'"
    $ EXIT

1 TYPE
  Displays the contents of one or more sequential ASCII files at the
  terminal. A user-authored .COM file is read from the command-procedure
  store; a binary file (such as PEERS.DAT) returns %TYPE-W-NOTASCII.

  Format:

    TYPE file-spec[,...]

1 UNSHELVE
  Restores a shelved SCADA alarm (see HELP SHELVE) to the primary
  annunciator. If the underlying condition is still present the alarm
  re-annunciates immediately.

  Format:

    UNSHELVE ALARM alarm-id

1 WAIT
  Suspends the procedure or the interactive session for the specified
  delta time.

  Format:

    WAIT hh:mm:ss[.cc]

1 WRITE
  Writes a line to an open file or to a logical device. WRITE
  SYS$OUTPUT echoes a literal string to the terminal; other destinations
  return a WRITERR condition in this shell.

  Format:

    WRITE logical-name expression
"""
}
